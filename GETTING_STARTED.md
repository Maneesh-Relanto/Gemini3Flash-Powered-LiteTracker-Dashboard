# Getting Started with LiteTrack

## Step 1: Initial Setup
- Deploy your Cloudflare Worker using the template in the **Deployment** tab.
- Ensure your Worker has CORS headers configured to allow requests from your dashboard or production domain.

## Step 2: Live Verification

### 1. Configure the Dashboard
- Go to the **Integration** tab.
- Paste your Cloudflare Worker URL (e.g., `https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev`).

### 2. Open Cloudflare Observability
- Log in to your Cloudflare Dashboard.
- Navigate to your worker's settings.
- Click the **Logs** or **Observability** tab.
- Click the **"Live"** button to start streaming real-time logs.

### 3. Verify Connection
- Go back to the LiteTrack app and use the **Event Simulator**.
- Click **"Immediate Ping"** or send a custom payload.
- **Check your Cloudflare window:**
    1. A new **POST** request should appear in the log stream.
    2. Click on that row to expand it.
    3. You will see the message `Event Received: ...` along with your JSON payload.

## Step 3: Conversion Funnels

Funnels allow you to visualize the journey your users take and identify exactly where they drop off. **In this dashboard, the Funnel is computed in real-time from the events you send.**

### 1. Navigate to Funnels
- Click the **Funnels** icon (Pie Chart) in the left sidebar.
- You will see the "Conversion Pipeline" based on current data.

### 2. How to "Work" the Funnel
To see if the funnel is tracking correctly:
- Go to the **Integration** tab.
- Look for the **"Funnel Triggers"** list.
- Click **"4. Complete Journey"**.
- Go back to the **Funnels** tab.
- **Result:** You will see the count for the "Completed" step increase by 1, and the total conversion percentage will update.

### 3. Understand the Rules
The funnel currently uses these simple logic rules:
- **Visited Home**: Events where `path` is `/home`.
- **Viewed Pricing**: Events where `path` is `/pricing`.
- **Started Signup**: Events with `type: "signup_start"`.
- **Completed**: Events with `type: "purchase_complete"`.

### 4. Act on AI Insights
- Scroll to the bottom of the Funnels page to view **Pain Points Identified**.
- These insights are generated by analyzing your traffic patterns and highlighting specific areas (like high pricing page drop-offs) that need your attention.
